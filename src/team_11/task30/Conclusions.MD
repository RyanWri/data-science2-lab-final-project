There are some conclusions that can be drawn from this visualization:
1. We can see that the optimal clusters number is 5.
2. cluster 0 seems younger, while cluster 1 seems older. cluster 2 seems like outliers,  cluster 3 os the most diverse in age and cluster 4 seems similar to cluster 3, only with smaller amount of patients.
3. All clusters seem to have pretty similar normally distributed BMI, except for cluster 2 which seems to have completely irrational values of BMI. The data of it probably misfiled.
4. It seems like the height varies significantly between clusters: cluster 0 and 1 represent short people, while cluster 3 represents higher people. Cluster 4 is somewhere in between, ony with fewer people. Cluster 2, however, represents irrationally short people (or perhaps babies).
5. The weight seems normally distributed pretty equally between clusters. However, it seems like cluster 3 has more mid-weight people.
6. It seems like cluster 3 contains more Males than others while cluster 1 and 4 contain more Females. Other clusters are hard to identify via Gender.
7. Education has so many values that it seems irrelevant to see how the clusters are divided.
8. cluster 3 contains significant amount of married people, while cluster 1 contains mostly widowers. cluster 4 ALso mostly contains married people, it is just smaller.
