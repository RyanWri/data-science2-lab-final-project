Type of target variable: discrete.
  Possible target labels: "rehospitalized", "non-rehospitalized"

Type of feature variable: discrete.
  Possible target labels: "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"

Conditions for statistical relationship test are not met, because of definitive bias:
  Number of rehospitilied patients: 7033 VS number of non-rehospitilized patients: 0
  We are unable to create "contingency table" that is a requirement for Chi-Squared or Fisher's Tests.

Conclusion: it is impossible to state presence of statistical relationship between day-of-week and rehospitalization.
