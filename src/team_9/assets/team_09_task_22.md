# Target variable
* Type: discrete
* Possible target labels: `"rehospitalized"`, `"non-rehospitalized"`

# Feature variable
* Type: discrete
* Possible feature labels: `"Sunday"`, `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`, `"Wednesday"`, `"Thursday"`, `"Friday"`, `"Saturday"`

# Analysis output
```
Conditions for statistical relationship test are not met, because of definitive bias:
  Number of rehospitilied patients: 7033 VS number of non-rehospitilized patients: 0
  We are unable to create "contingency table" that is a requirement for Chi-Squared or Fisher's Tests.
```

# Conclusion
It is impossible to state presence of statistical relationship between day-of-week and rehospitalization.
