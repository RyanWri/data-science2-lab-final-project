Purpose:
The goal was to identify an optimal statistical distribution that fits the number of days patients spend during their second hospitalization.

Data Preprocessing:

The data was first normalized to ensure comparability across different ranges of values.
A histogram of the normalized hospitalization days was plotted to visually inspect the distribution pattern.
Data Analysis:

Multiple statistical distributions (e.g., Normal, Exponential, Log-normal) were tested to fit the data.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed to quantify the goodness-of-fit for these distributions.
Result:
The analysis suggested that while the data did not perfectly fit any single distribution, it exhibited characteristics most closely aligned with an exponential distribution. This implies that a higher proportion of patients have shorter hospital stays, while a smaller proportion have extended stays.
