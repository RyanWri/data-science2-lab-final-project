Histogram with Exponential Distribution:

The first graph you provided is a histogram of the number of days in the second hospitalization, which has been normalized.
The shape of the distribution suggests that the data is heavily skewed to the right, with most patients having short hospital stays and a few having much longer stays. This kind of distribution is typical for hospital stay data.
The curve overlaid on the histogram is likely representing an exponential distribution, which is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process (e.g., time between successive hospitalizations).
Reconstructed Days with VAE (Variational Autoencoder):

The second graph compares the original normalized days of hospitalization with the reconstructed values from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
The red dashed line represents the ideal scenario where the original and reconstructed values match perfectly (i.e., where the model's predictions are completely accurate).
The scatter of points around this line indicates how well the VAE has managed to capture the underlying distribution of hospitalization days.
The correlation seen between the original and reconstructed days suggests that the VAE is reasonably effective at capturing the underlying patterns, although there is some variance, particularly for higher values.
Conclusion:
Distribution Fit: The histogram's shape and the nature of the exponential distribution curve suggest that an exponential distribution might be a good fit for the number of days in the second hospitalization. The VAE further supports this by showing a reasonable level of accuracy in reconstructing the data, even though it is not perfect.
VAE as a Deep Learning Method: The VAE was used to learn the distribution of hospitalization days. It provides a deep learning-based validation that the exponential-like behavior observed in the histogram is consistent
